    <p>I am Onur, an R&D software engineer and a machine learning enthusiast.</p>

    <p>This site is the less boring version of my CV, plus some personal content.</p>

    <p>I have extensive interest and <i>some</i> knowledge in C++ and Python.
       This covers multi-threaded programming, standard libraries, OOP and TMP,
       and some relevant libraries/frameworks (mostly computer vision and deep
       learning) for both. I do not have a formal software engineering background,
       but I am in constant endeavour to compensate. </p>

    <p>As of 2020, I have moved to Gothenburg, Sweden to join Zenseact AB (previously
       known as Zenuity AB.) Here, I became a member of the object detection team in
       order to contribute to Zenseact's autonomus driving functionality. Before that
       I was responsible for development and maintenance of a face recognition service
       software at Artge Technologies, Istanbul, Turkey. </p>

    <p>Both of these roles involve deployment of trained neural network models to
       production, and trainings itself in some cases. Hence I have experience in software
       design and implementation as well as algorithm prototyping in the scope of deep
       learning applications.</p>
